# Day3 Part2 - *No Matter How You Slice It*

Amidst the chaos, you notice that exactly one claim doesn't overlap by even a single square inch of fabric with any other claim. If you can somehow draw attention to it, maybe the Elves will be able to make Santa's suit after all!

For example, consider the following claims:

* `# 1 @ 1,3: 4x4`
* `# 2 @ 3,1: 4x4`
* `# 3 @ 5,5: 2x2`

For example, in the claims above, only claim 3 is intact after all claims are made.

What is the **ID of the only claim that doesn't overlap**?
